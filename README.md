_Dataset_: [_Tesla Stocks Prediction_](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naiyakhalid/tesla-stocks-data)

## Objective

You are required to study the assigned dataset, understand its fields, and improve the visualizations already present. The goal is to make the visualizations more informative, aesthetically pleasing, and meaningful. Your focus should be on improving clarity, readability, and the ability to extract insights from the visual data. Additionally, search for web resources available for the analysis of the same data and report them. You may also compare your results with those found in the resources.

## 1. Understanding the Data

- Try to understand the context and origin of the dataset. If the latest upgraded dataset is available, use it instead of an older version.
- Explore the fields (columns) in the dataset and identify the type of data (numerical, categorical, text, etc.) and its role (independent, dependent variables).
- Provide a brief description of the dataset you selected and list out the fields with their definitions.

## 2. Analysis of Existing Visualizations

- Consider all the visualizations from the dataset (provided in the link or found elsewhere).
- Critically analyze these visualizations based on the following aspects:
  - Clarity of representation.
  - Relevance of the chart type to the data.
  - Ability to reveal insights or patterns.
  - Aesthetic quality and color contrast.
  - Are axes, labels, legends, and titles sufficiently clear?

## 3. Improvement Proposal

Suggest improvements for each selected visualization:

- Choose more appropriate chart types (e.g., histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots, etc.).
- Enhance color schemes using industry-standard contrast guidelines.
- Adjust layout, font sizes, or scaling for better clarity.
- Add interactivity (if relevant).

## 4. Implementation

- Using Python libraries (Matplotlib/Seaborn), recreate the visualizations based on your suggested improvements.
- For each chart, explain why you made the changes and how they enhance the insight extraction.

## 5. Deliverables

- A Jupyter notebook containing:
  - A brief introduction to the dataset.
  - A critical review of the existing visualizations.
  - The improved visualizations along with your reasoning for the changes.
  - Insights gained from the new visualizations.
- Ensure that your visuals have suitable fonts and colors, with transparent backgrounds, as per industry standards.

## 6. Presentation Guidelines

Create a 10-15 slide presentation that follows these storytelling guidelines:

- Start with an introduction to the dataset and its significance.
- Present the key questions or hypotheses explored using the data.
- Use improved visualizations to build a cohesive narrative, showing trends, correlations, and key insights.
- Conclude with key insights.
- At the end, include a table detailing each team member's contributions, analysis, and use of resources.

| Name | Roll No. | Contribution in Analysis (Part of data analyzed) | Web Resources/Codes/AI Tools Used (Purpose of usage) | Overall Contribution (%) |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |

| 2    |          |                                                  |                                                      |                          |
| 3    |          |                                                  |                                                      |                          |

## Evaluation Criteria

- Depth of understanding and analysis of the dataset.
- Creativity and clarity in improving visualizations.
- Ability to create a clear, compelling narrative using visual data storytelling.
- Quality of PowerPoint presentation (structure, design, and storytelling).

## Allowed Tools

You can use generative AI tools to refine your work, but **substantial effort must be your own**.

## Exploration Assignment

In addition to the assigned dataset, you must explore other publicly available datasets either independently or as a team. Identifying a relevant dataset and proposing questions for exploration is **mandatory** for all groups.

### Guidelines for Dataset Exploration

1. **Justification for Dataset Choice**:

   - **Interest**: Explain why this dataset appeals to you.
   - **Relevance**: How does it relate to business, management, or other fields?
   - **Context**: Describe the origin and background of the data.
   - **Insights**: State the primary insights or trends you hope to uncover.

2. **Potential Sources for Publicly Available Data**:
